## 📅 Day 01 – Toy Block Project

- Created a **component**
- Used **2-point rectangle** and **center circle** in sketch mode
- Applied **dimension constraints** for accurate sizing
- Positioned sketches using the **origin**
- Used the **extrude** tool to create 3D geometry
- Applied a **rectangular pattern** to duplicate features

✔️ Topics Covered:
- Components  
- Sketching basics (rectangle, circle)  
- Dimensioning  
- Extrude (Join)  
- Rectangular pattern

## 📅 Day 02 – Glass Bottle from Reference Image

- Imported a reference image using the **Canvas tool**
- Used **Calibrate** to adjust the real-world scale of the image
- Traced the image using **Straight Lines** and **Splines**
- Applied **Revolve** to create the 3D shape from profile
- Used **Fillet** to smooth the bottom rough surface
- Applied **Shell** to hollow the inside of the bottle
- Added another **Fillet** to smooth the top edge
- Applied **Glass texture** using the **Appearance tool**

✔️ Topics Covered:
- Canvas import
- Calibrate tool
- Sketching with splines
- Revolve
- Fillet
- Shell (Hollow)
- Applying appearances (glass)

## 📅 Day 03 – Making a Paper Clip

- Created a **Component**
- Used **Line tool** to sketch the outer path of the paper clip
- Used **Construction line** to control distance for arc placement
- Used **Tangent Arc tool** to create smooth bends along the path
- Created another sketch for the **sweep profile** (a circle with center point)
- Applied the **Sweep tool** to follow the sketched path and form the 3D wire

✔️ Topics Covered:
- Components
- Line tool
- Construction geometry
- Tangent arc
- Sweep (path & profile)
